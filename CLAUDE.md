# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the `back_tutor` repository - currently a new project in its initial setup phase.

## Current State

- Repository is initialized with git
- Claude Code permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`
- No application code or build system has been established yet

## Development Workflow

Since this is a new repository, the development workflow will depend on the technology stack chosen. Common next steps typically include:

- Initializing a package manager (npm, yarn, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Setting up a build system and development dependencies
- Establishing project structure and entry points
- Configuring linting, testing, and CI/CD

## Notes for Future Development

- Update this file as the project architecture and build system are established
- Document key commands for building, testing, and running the application
- Include information about the chosen technology stack and frameworks
- Add guidance on project structure and coding conventions once established
